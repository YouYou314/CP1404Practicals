# REFLECTION
- Estimates for Practical Tasks: At first, we often misjudged the time and resources needed for programming tasks. But with more practice, our estimates are getting better.

- Code Reviews: Getting my code reviewed helped me see where I can improve and learn new techniques. Reviewing others' code exposed me to different coding styles and problem-solving methods.

- Changes to Practical Tasks: I would add more real-life tasks to make the coursework more relatable and interesting. Also, working together on coding tasks, like pair programming, could be really helpful as it reflects how things work in the actual software industry.
